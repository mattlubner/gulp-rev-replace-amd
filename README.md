================

Fork of [gulp-rev-replace](https://github.com/jamesknelson/gulp-rev-replace).

[Gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp) plugin to rewrite references to javascript files in AMD modules (e.g., references lack the .js extension) which have been renamed by [gulp-rev](https://github.com/sindresorhus/gulp-rev).
